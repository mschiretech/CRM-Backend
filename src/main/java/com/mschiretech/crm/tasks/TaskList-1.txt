    terminal gui and more functions for internal guis(sub-options) !
    in the function include all the input and output handling !
    then use switch statement for calling the specific functions !
    For using the methods inherit the class in other classes !

        Note : Use separate Main methods ! other than the CrmBackendApplication Class file !
               Do not modify the main method inside it ! Create multiple other main methods !
               Create a separate folder/directory under : com.mschiretech.crm ->

2.  Under com.mschiretech.crm -> Create a new package name core, inside it Create another package named features
    inside it create a class inside it create all the methods like view all customers, add new customer etc..
    then inherit the class by the class containing the method for terminal gui !
        Features :
            -> View All Customers
            -> Add new customer
            -> get customer by name

            -> message customer
            -> show all the messages of a customer
            -> export to csv file
            -> import from csv file

            etc....

3.  under core create a new package named "tempdb" then define all the required
    database structure and columns you need !along with their datatypes !
    for creating a database use jdbc or create a class containing the data members as the columns !
    and create another class and create multiple objects of the structure/data class
    then access the data through the objects using .(dot) operator !
    create functions for injecting some demo/dummy data to the objects ! for testing purposes !
    and write methods for all the database functionality like Create, Get, Update, Delete, etc...
    databases structures to be created :
        -> Customer DB
        -> Messages DB
        -> Projects DB
        -> Logs DB
        -> Stats DB
        -> APIs DB

    Note : You can use file handling too instead of object creation !

4.  under the core create a package networking ! under that create a class file
    containing methods for sending and receiving data using http/https protocol !
    create Several get and post methods for sending user data to the server !
    create functions like :
        -> send all users to server
        -> get all users from server
        -> get server stats
        -> post update user !
        etc..

5.  under the core -> networking package create a package named jsonEn
    under it create a class file containing several methods for formatting
    raw data to json format for ease in sending it to the server !
    and decoding json data to raw data !
    Create several methods like :
        -> user format
        -> update user format
        -> get users format
        etc...
    demo json structure :
        {
